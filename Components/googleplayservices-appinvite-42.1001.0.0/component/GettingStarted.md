App Invites provide a powerful way to organically grow your app, user-to-user. Your users recommend your app to their friends using personalized, contextual invitations powered by Google. App Invites provide a great onboarding experience to your new users. Google optimizes your app install rates by reducing friction and using relevant context at every step of the user invitation flow.



Required Android API Levels
===========================

We recommend setting your app's *Target Framework* and *Target Android version* to **Android 5.0 (API Level 21)** or higher in your app project settings.

This Google Play Service SDK's requires a *Target Framework* of at least Android 4.1 (API Level 16) to compile.

You may still set a lower *Minimum Android version* (as low as Android 2.3 - API Level 9) so your app will run on older versions of Android, however you must ensure you do not use any API's at runtime that are not available on the version of Android your app is running on.
