# Developing for Android Wear

Small, powerful devices, worn on the body. Useful information when you need it most. Intelligent answers to spoken questions. Tools to help reach fitness goals. Your key to a multiscreen world.

Android Wear extends the Android platform to a new generation of devices, 
with a user experience that's designed specifically for wearables.


### Synced Notifications

Notifications on handhelds can automatically sync to wearables, so design them with both devices in mind.

### Voice Actions

Register your app to handle voice actions, like "Ok Google, take a note," for a hands-free experience.


### Build Wearable Apps

Create custom experiences with activities, services, sensors, and much more with the Android SDK.


### Send Data

Send data and actions between handhelds and wearables with data replication APIs and RPCs.
